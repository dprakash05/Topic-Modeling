353181488,"We chatting to jack and ended chat but thought of something else. Actually, one thing on checking the policy is that we didn't realise that skis weren't included and had to be mentioned separately. Is there a standard value that can be covered for separately or do we say how much we want the skis covered for etc"
353181488,Do we need to specify make and model etc or just 'skis'
353181488,"Okay I will get my husband to check details etc and come back to you. Is this something I can add via live chat, or will I need to ring up to add"
353181488,Ok. Many thanks Claire.
353181488,Actually are you able to tell me apps how much it will be to cover skis for about #NUM
353181488,"Also, they are a couple of years old. So do we look up current new price and then are they covered New for old"
353181489,"Good morning Damian, I was involved in an accident last week and my vehicle is currently being repaired"
353181489,"I'm trying to review my documents to see if I have third party cover on my policy to drive another vehicle in the meantime, could you help me"
353181489,"Perfect, I've been trying to find it but couldn't, have been reading this doc for #NUM minutes"
353181489,"That's everything thanks, have a good day"

353182355,
353182355,Yes
353182355,All fine

353182355,That's fine please go ahead
353182355,"That was all, thank you."
353182683,I already hold a policy for car insurance with your self and i spoke to someone at work who mentioned multicar
353182683,but i will just add i amended the policy the other day to insure my new car and have only just noticed the amendment hasnt actually gone through
353182683,No it isnt. Im wanting to change the main insurance to the vehicle #ALNUM RBX which i did the other day and it came up with no changes to your premium
353182683,Yeah thats where the problem is. I want the other car on the proper insurance as at the moment im looking to take the ML off the road as it needs some things doing to it however once everything is fixed im wanting to then maybe add it on to this insurance given the multicar insurance is a good saving
353182683,"Thats what ive just tried to do and it said there was an error and to contact you,"
353182683,It just said there was a technical issue with the website and to contact you

353184581,I have declared #NUM years NCD on my recent Policy application. This was earned via my last Company Car. I have a letter from my employer and Insurance provider stating the periods when I was accident free. Do you want a copy of this letter and if so can I email a copy to you at what address Thanks
353184581,Yes
353184581,Yes when I left the Company effective #NUM December #NUM I have now purchased a car  just insured with XYZ that I will use for my new Company business.
353184581,This is not stated on the Insurance application. If I am unable to enjoy I want to cancel the application just made and get a full refund. Will you action this immediately please
353184581,That fine thank you but disappointing that the Policy application does not clearly state the NCD via Company cars is invalid. Perhaps you can highlight this to the Company for future
